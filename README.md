# Hangman-Game
"The Hangman game is a guessing game in which we ask the user to guess a word. While designing this game, we have created two functions: one for guessing the word and the other for displaying the word. In this game, if the guessed letter is present in the word, then the letter is displayed; otherwise, it's displayed with an underscore.

We have our main function under which we have laid some conditions:

Only a single letter is to be entered, which should be alphabetical.
If the guessed letter is present in the word, a message is displayed indicating that the guess is correct.
If the guess is repeated, i.e., it's already present in the list of guessed letters, then the user is instructed that they have already guessed that letter.
If the word is correctly guessed before completing the attempts, a message is displayed indicating that the word has been correctly guessed.
If the attempts are completed as we run the loop, a message is displayed, and the game is ended."
